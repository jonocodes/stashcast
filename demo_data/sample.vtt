00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Welcome to this tutorial on Python programming.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Today we're going to learn about Django web framework.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.200
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.800
It was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion quickly.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.500
Django follows the model-view-template architectural pattern.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.800
This pattern separates the data layer from the presentation layer.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.200
One of Django's main goals is to ease the creation of complex database-driven websites.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.500
The framework emphasizes reusability and pluggability of components.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.800
Django includes an ORM that allows you to interact with databases using Python code.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.200
You don't need to write SQL queries directly in most cases.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.500
The admin interface is another powerful feature that comes built-in.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.800
It allows you to manage your application's data without writing any additional code.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.200
Django also includes form handling, authentication, and security features out of the box.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.500
The framework has excellent documentation and a large community of developers.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.800
This makes it easy to find help and resources when you need them.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.200
In this series, we'll build a complete web application step by step.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.500
We'll cover models, views, templates, forms, and much more.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.800
By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of Django development.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.200
Let's get started with our first Django project.
